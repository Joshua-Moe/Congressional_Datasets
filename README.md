# Congressional_Datasets
A repository consisting of scripts for creating United States Congressional Datasets 1951-1981 and eventually data exploration.

I am using html files rather than retrieving the same data via URL for two reasons:
1) I do NOT want to risk being IP banned from Wikipedia.
2) If they ever change the layout of their webpages, this scraper might not work in the future.

I have 3 goals for this project.
1) Webscraping/Parsing/Data Manipulation showcase of skills.
2) Explore the datasets to illustrate the "Great Switch (1960s)" to see if and to what extent politicians switched parties.
3) Use these datasets to populate a database.


TO DO: Add instructions to run the script.
